<div class="tl">
<p>Collectively, I’ve probably answered over a thousand Piazza posts. Most of them are homework-specific or RTFM, but some are possibly useful enough to exist on their own. Edited and cleaned up to hopefully make sense.</p>

<p>Random thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li> I’ve felt that anthropomorphizing concepts is sometimes a little too patronizing. But apparently, the Recursion Fairy is well and alive at Illinois, and I have seen some empirical success in doing this as well... </li>
<li> Teaching first-year intro courses is much easier than higher-level courses. You can predict everything they’ll ask in the former. I’m not so sure about the latter.. we’ll see. <span class="strike">Hopefully I don’t suck at office hours.</span> Yep, was a lot harder.</li>
<li> I feel I should have some 445 posts in here, but I'm not in the mood to trawl through the Piazza.. let's defer that to when TAing for PhD requirements. </li>
