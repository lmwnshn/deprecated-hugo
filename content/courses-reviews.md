☆: courses which I thought were worth attending CMU for. Roughly speaking, one star means "fundamental shift in mindset" and two stars means "transformative experience". A course without stars might still be good. Opinions are free if you want them, reach out by email.

Semester difficulty ratings: {light, medium, heavy, death} corresponding to {lots of free time, routine, strict routine and some all nighters, regular all nighters}. I generally aim for medium to heavy semesters.

Context: I entered CMU with decent programming background and meh math background. I'm generally better at systems than theory. I strongly prefer reading ahead.

# PhD

PhD life is very different from undergrad life.

- You take 2 courses where in undergrad you'd normally take 3-5 comparable courses.
- Your courses should all have some aspect of research to them.
- If you're spending most of your time on your classes, then your priorities may not be in the right place.

Practically, I find that this means:

- You actually have the time to do the reading.
- You even have the time to take nice notes, and really absorb the material.

## Spring 2021

- 15-745 Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures
- 15-884 Machine Learning Systems
- 15-996 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Computer Science and Society (Pilot)

Note: Still Zoom lectures, unfortunately. 745 is a nice course for learning about dataflow frameworks and traditional compiler passes, but you're probably not going to be doing anything particularly cutting-edge there. 884 is actually a quite interesting course, the equivalent version that TQ used to teach at UW is highly regarded and I can see why. This is the first time 884 is being offered here, but I would say that if it improves in future iterations then it'll be a star-worthy course. Right now, you get what you put into it, but TQ definitely knows his stuff.

## Fall 2021

- No classes

# Undergrad

## Spring 2020

- **A** ☆☆ 15-410 Operating System Design and Implementation
- **A** 15-780 Graduate Artificial Intelligence
- **B** 21-301 Combinatorics
- **A** 33-120 Science and Science Fiction

Other commitments: essentially nothing  
Overall: heavy

Note: OS deserves its pedestal. I think it is excellent as either a first-course (for the highly motivated and confident) or as a systems capstone (it ties everything together nicely). The coronavirus happened around this time which complicated the semester in various ways. Combinatorics was more interesting than expected (covered a little spectral graph theory and probabilistic stuff).

## Fall 2019

- TA 15-445
- **A** 15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming
- **B** 15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory
- **B** ☆☆ 15-857 Analytical Performance Modeling
- **A** ☆☆ 15-859 Algorithms for Big Data

Dropped: 15-462, 21-301   
Other commitments: database group  
Overall: death

Note: I think 418 is a good first or second systems course. It is not so good as a fourth. UCT is very well-taught and tries to incorporate newer results, which is very neat. I just found 857 and 859 much more interesting to sink time into, and the BusTub was often on fire.

## Spring 2019

- **P** 69-102 Weight Training
- **A** 70-366 Intellectual Property and E-Commerce
- **A** 79-387 General Francisco Franco: Fascism and its Legacies in Spain

Other commitments: database group, paper submissions  
Overall: heavy, sometimes death
