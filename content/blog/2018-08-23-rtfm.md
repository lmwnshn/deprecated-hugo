I've been talking to a bunch of people about 213 over the past week. hm. I still do not think that you need the book. Just read the source code! Code lies less than documentation does.

Brought back a funny memory from taking 440 though. I was either done with the course or halfway through the last project, and then someone casually asked me something about the project library documentation. Documentation? What documentation??? I thought we were just supposed to read the source for everything and didn't question it. Went back and read everything I missed - whoops, would have made the projects **much** easier.

Now that class is starting, that's something to keep in mind while I TA. Point out that documentation exists! Wield the appendix! Because you'll get students.. *ahem* me *ahem*... who will finish the entire module without realizing it.
