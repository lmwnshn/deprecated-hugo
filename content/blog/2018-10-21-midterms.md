WAUUUUU I GOT AN A ON A CDM MIDTERM

---

Midterm grades are all out. I'm generally happy as long as I'm around the average, but that wasn't quite true this sem : ) New semester, new records! Coming dangerously close to a repeat of vector.

In terms of relative performance, CDM >> PL >> 445. I was kind of expecting the reverse, but it does reflect the amount of effort I put into them. Maybe I'll get disowned by Pavlo tomorrow though.

But overall, it looks like my midsem grades won't be _too_ alarming.

Okay, back to project.
