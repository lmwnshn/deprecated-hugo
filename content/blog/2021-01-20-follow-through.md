I went to sleep in an extremely bad mood on Monday, apologizing to someone for not being in the mood to talk.

I woke up and their first message asked if I was feeling better. I wasn't, actually, until I read that. Then well, maybe I'm still spending time on something I'd rather not be spending time on, but that's something to be grateful for.

Saw [this](https://twitter.com/dinoman_j/status/1351099875082047489) little dinosaur on Twitter afterwards and they came to mind.

I think follow-through as a concept is underrated.

My first exposure to the idea of follow-through was probably in martial arts as a kid. I never got very far, but one takeaway was that if you wanted to punch through something, you don't stop at the surface. Aim to reach through, push through, follow through. That's the difference between tapping a board and breaking it in half.

In a way, though, life is like that too. To me, the difference between effective support and disingenuous support is in the follow-through. For most, promises are cheap to make and cheaper still to break, and we're all probably guilty of some version of the internet "HERE ARE ALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINES! I'M HELPING!" drive-by. There's nothing inherently wrong with pawning off problems to future you or to trained professionals, but often that would be the extent of it.

So, to what extent am I willing to follow-through on help originally extended?

If I tried sufficiently hard, I could probably change one life. I believe in education's ability to move people upwards in life. I can point to specific people and specific ways in which this has been true for me.

But there is a certain sense of futility and of time ill-spent. Not that there are better ways to use time, but that there are no good ways of using time, though ultimately it is something that is all give and no take.

I generally don't want that much out of life. In 2010, I wanted exactly one thing. Over the past couple of years, I have since grown to want another thing. Two things for which I would trade the world -- both free, and yet both unattainable in an implausible sense.

So I suppose there is no harm in continuing to wander around like a little lost sheep for now. Maybe some day I'll want something that I can actually have.

More frivolously, I have had altogether too many food cravings in the past week. At least those "wants" are easily satisfied.

I've felt a mental flipflop coming for the past couple of days. I'm pretty irritable right now, and I'm having more difficulty sleeping. Probably started on Wednesday. And will either be further inflamed or be acquiesced later today.

Sometimes I think my mental state is very balanced, in a less ideal sense -- ask nothing of it and it'll ask nothing back, ask too much and it'll need to vent afterwards. Which is normal in the abstract, and abnormal in my execution.

Well, no Sibyl yet exists. But perhaps it is better to preemptively stab the picture after all.

30, or 2030? Perhaps both.

To want nothing and to want for nothing.

So similar, and yet so different.
