You brought me ginger tea when I was coughing and badgered me into seeing a doctor when I had fever. Reached out when I was being a depressed loner and helped me find meaning in life.

For all that, I was just another student. But to you, every student is special.

In your eyes, I mattered. And that was all I needed.

I've never been more than an average student. Every night of my first year was spent quietly crying. But you changed that. Around you, I felt valued. I could ask and be answered. Talk and be listened to. You genuinely cared about me as a person and encouraged me to try. I would not be where I am today without you.

"Teaching is an art, a craft. My lifetime passion." And it showed. You set the highest standard of teaching, inside and outside the classroom, that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I hope to one day make as much of a difference in a life as you have made in mine.

Rest peacefully.
