I've been spending winter break attending a few (mostly programming-oriented) [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cities/us/pa/pittsburgh/). CMU is actually pretty good background preparation here. But I digress.

Reviewing the semesters I've had so far, I realize quality of life (as measured by sleep) has generally been on a downwards slide.

- Fall 2016
	- Time spent on: concepts
	- A fairly relaxing semester, overall
- Spring 2017
	- Time spent on: 251, attempt at 269
	- In retrospect, working midnight to 8am on Sundays was a pretty bad idea here
	- My life smoothed out after dropping 269, though a fairly rough semester overall
- Fall 2017
	- Time spent on: algebraic structures, TAing 122
	- To be fair to 122, I didn't need to sink that much time into it
		- I vaguely regret turning down some networking dinners because they conflicted with Tuesday grading
		- But I definitely don't regret having extra OH, especially the night before homeworks are due
	- But when you prioritize other people's stuff over your own, you end up sleeping at 3 to 4 am a lot. hm.. balance is tough.
	- This was a pretty bad semester, work-life wise. It wasn't even the 210 and 213; mostly the math courses.
		- "Well, if you're bad at math, maybe you shouldn't minor in it"... well-meaning advice that I get fairly often
		- Still thinking about it..
		- If I didn't want to struggle, I wouldn't have picked CMU
		- Persona quotes seem relevant here.. I chose this fate of my own free will

## Resolutions

In no particular order,

- Get more sleep!
	- First semester without 830/9am classes
	- Aiming to sleep from 1am to 9am
		- Way more sleep than I've gotten for the past two years
		- No more amortizing sleep
- Cook more!
	- Sure, Oishii is a decent deal (meet all food requirements for about 300/month)
		- Coming from someone who earned USD 350 a month full-time at some point..
		- I am very fortunate. As are the people who live here.
	- But it would be fun and much cheaper to cook, and I miss some foods
- Find time for meetups
	- I'd like to keep going to two of them
	- But the Monday one probably won't happen, because 150 will have panic OH then
	- The Wednesday one is possible, though
- Do something that's actually useful
	- I'm actually surprised that volunteer slots fill up so quickly around here.
	- Rather nice, really. Look for the helpers.
	- It would be nice to find a shelter or something to volunteer for regularly
- Rust!
	- I really want to play with Rust more
	- I wonder if I'll have the time to port all my 440 code to Rust

Round 4, begin!
