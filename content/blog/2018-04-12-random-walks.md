The weather in Pittsburgh is pretty wild. From snow to rain to a sunny afternoon in the span of a week, almost like someone compressed time.

Speaking of time, my sense of time is a little broken right now. Looking forward to the day that I don't need to set a 3am alarm; hopefully carnival will do that. I'm a little annoyed that after all that proofreading, I still didn't catch the mistake before it went out, but I guess I can't ask too much from sleepy me.

In any case, the weather today was really nice. So I stopped thinking about markov chains and random walks and went on a walk myself instead.

It's been a little over a year since I went to this spot. I used to climb down to get there, but it seems like there's a path now which reaches all the way to the road below. Or was the path always there?

I couldn't find a path down to that rocky overhang today, so I couldn't see what was new there.

The birbs are back!

Incidentally, I've gotten pretty bad at eyeballing a good route. On the plus side, my reflexes are fine.

Not pictured: the part of the hill where the earth shifted, I grabbed a tree while sliding down, got stuck for a little while, made little earth avalanches and eventually continued up

Pictured instead: my favorite spot, though getting here is a bit of a chore now. I might start taking the actual path up from the side.

And a squirrel! Hi squirrel!

Some things are worth [making time](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/01/14) for.
