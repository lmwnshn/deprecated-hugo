Saw Jim again today, he had a coat on. Still wonder how he normally gets through winter, though. I think I've met him five times now, and each time he's been pretty pleasant to talk to. Might sit down for lunch with him if he's around and I can find the time.

The stories behind the people that we as a society collectively ignore.. I would have liked to meet Shuffles and Beastmaster, I think. I feel a lot of them are fundamentally good. Given the support system that a lot of us take for granted, what would they have gone on to do? hm.
