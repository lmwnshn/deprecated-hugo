I'm a little tired of living in interesting times.

---

I am frustrated that I am not very good at tutoring what appears to be called precalc / algebra two in the US. I am also frustrated with Google Jamboard and the fact that students are limited to the clunky mouse writing experience.

I am even more frustrated, that public education here -- of all countries -- appears to be in a deeply questionable state of affairs. What exactly is the point of teaching formulas and methods if people don't understand why they work? I did grow up in similar systems and I think I did well enough in them. But it is 2021, and America is so resource-rich...

Well, I am also similarly frustrated by a little code right now. The easy thing would have been to ignore the mud and pile onto it. The less easy thing is actually reading the code and fixing it, and that's quite a bit of fixing so far. There is no course at CMU that teaches you Python particularly well, though, so it is understandable. And part of it is not so much Python but also a question of API design, which I think I only really started to "get" after OS partner chats.

A rather frustrating day, all in all.
